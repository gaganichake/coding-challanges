 * A loan has the following data points:
 * 
 * Lender (string)
 * Preapproved (boolean)
 * APR (float)
 * 
 * Youâ€™re given a list of loans, a desired page size, and need to paginate them with certain constraints:
 * 
 * Each page has at most pageSize items.
 * A preapproved loan must be the first item on each page if one is available. Preapproved loans cannot show up in any other position other than first. Make new pages if necessary.
 * A lender appears at most once on each page. Make new pages if necessary.
 * Without violating the above constraints, return loans sorted in increasing APR since lower is better.
 * Without violating the above constraints, pages should be maximally compact (return the fewest possible pages).
