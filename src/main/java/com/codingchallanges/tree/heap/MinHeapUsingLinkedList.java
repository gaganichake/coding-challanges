/*
 * Implement MinHeap using Linked List.
 * 
 * Adding and removing elements (heapify operations) for a Heap is very costly O(n) using Arrays.
 * With Linked List adding and removing will take just O(1) operations. Also, Linked List size
 * is dynamic, hence capacity reservation is not required.
 *
 * A Min Heap is a Binary Tree where a parent node is always smaller than its child nodes.
 * 
 * The last element of the tree (array) is not necessarily the biggest element.
